# Real-time-intrusion-detector
This application tracks movement and objects that are visible in a video feed. 
These objects are checked against available models and if they match a dangerous object that is restricted, and if the accuracy percentage is high, the application flags the object and person in a box and prompts the user. 
A screenshot is saved of the object and person, and a message is sent to the designated person indicating the detection of contraband. The designated person can remotely view the item and disable the prompt remotely if necessary.
